Note that these files are slightly modified from the original demonstration files provided in the purr download.

I have modified the css and images to include an error colour for Drupal error messages. This can be expanded further with the css and more images.

The MIT licence is included here as these files are modified versions of files created by Net Perspective: http://net-perspective.com/
