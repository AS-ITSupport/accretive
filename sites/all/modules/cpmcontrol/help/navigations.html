<b>NAVIGATIONS</b>
<p>The website has the following types of navigation elements: Utility, Primary, Quick Links, and Footer.</p>
<b>UTILITY NAVIGATION</b>
<p>This is a site-wide content which can be seen in the uppermost right of the page. The items for this navigation are automatically added when you create/edit a content and choose "&lt;Utility Navigation&gt;" in the dropdown menu of “Parent Item“under “Menu Settings”.</p>

<b>PRIMARY NAVIGATION</b>
<p>This is a site-wide content which can be seen in the lower center of header. The items of this navigation are automatically populated. When you add/edit a content and choose "&lt;Primary links&gt;" in the dropdown menu of “Parent Item“under “Menu Settings”, the content title will be added to the Primary Navigation. However, this should be taken care cautiously since each link is displayed with different style based on the link name. If you should wish to add a new item in the Primary Navigation, a new set of styles will also be added for it.</p>
<b>QUICK LINKS NAVIGATION</b>
<p>This is a static block content that can be seen in the left part of the page in homepage and in the right part of the page in the inside pages. To edit this, just move your mouse over the Quick Links area and you will notice that it will be covered with a gray background and two icons will appear on top of it.</p>
