  <li>The duplicate contents are due to camps that belonged to different Session and groups. Click on the “edit” link aligned to the content you wished to modify.</li>
  <li>You will now be taken to a form page. Check first the “Camp Sessions” and “Camp Grades” field before editing. You might be editing the wrong content.
