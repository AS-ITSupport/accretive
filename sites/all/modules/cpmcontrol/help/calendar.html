<ul>

      	<b>Repeating Events:</b><br />
      	The following are tips when adding events that repeat:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the event repeats, you can set the “To date’ field either to an empty value or to the same value as the “From date” field.</li>
        <li>In the Advanced>Repeat section, Choose a frequency and period to repeat the event. Set the ending event date on “Until” field (if you want the event to end)</li>
        <li>The “Except” sec-tion will be used if you wish to omit a particular date from the repeating list.

      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>“Link to Event Description” dropdown menu will serve as the events link and description for the particular event. If set to “- None -“the event will still be displayed to the calendar but will not have a link on it.

	<b>How to modify the description of a particular calendar event:</b><br>
	There are two ways to modify an event calendar. First is to use the Page tabs or admin hover, and second is to use the “Content Editing -> Content” like on modifying calendar event.   
</p>  

<p>
	<b>Using Page tabs or Admin hover:</b><br />
	Event description is used in various pages: Activities -> Family Events, Activities -> Shows, Activities -> Early Education, and Activities -> Classes and Workshops. 
  Notice that if you are inside in one of these pages, a sub-navigation on the left sidebar shows up. Click on a particular event: ex. Earth Day on Family Events, 
  it would take you to the Earth Day page with Page tabs and Admin hover. Click on “Edit” on the tab or the first icon on admin hover that will redirect you to a form page. 
  Do the necessary edits and click “Save” button when done.
